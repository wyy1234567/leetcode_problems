# Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

# Example 1:
# Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

# @param {Integer[][]} intervals
# @return {Integer}
